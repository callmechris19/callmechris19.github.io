        <p><div style="margin-left:100px; margin-right:100px;">Human activity, mostly for food production and forestry, is transforming landscapes.
             Today, one third of all land is degraded or degrading, which harms biodiversity and jeopardises essential ecosystem services such as carbon storage. 
             Protected areas offer a solution. If effectively managed and fairly governed, such areas can safeguard nature and cultural resources, protect human health and well-being, provide sustainable livelihoods and so support sustainable development.
             Protected areas or conservation areas are locations which receive protection because of their recognized natural, ecological or cultural values. 
             There are several kinds of protected areas, which vary by level of protection depending on the enabling laws of each country or the regulations of the international organizations involved. 
             Generally speaking though, protected areas are understood to be those in which human presence or at least the exploitation of natural resources is limitted. Some importance of protected areas include: 
             To provide safe havens for wild plants and animals,To sustain and strengthen Indigenous knowledge and value systems and their application in the conservation of landscapes and cultural practices of significance for Indigenous peoples and all life.
             To strengthen our resilience to climate change and some others importance.</div></p>

             <p><div style="margin-left:100px; margin-right:100px;">We address these differences in protected and unprotected lands' characteristics using matching. 
                Matching is a treatment or policy evaluation method that can help to reduce the influence of the non-random application of a treatment(here legal protection). 
                For each PA location that is included within such an impact evaluation, matching picks the most similar unprotected sites to best provide apples to apples comparisons.
                 The point is that using all the available observed land characteristics to do this matching can greatly improve similarity between treated (protected) and control (unprotected) groups.
                 Beneficial impacts on wellbeing levels of communities living near Protected Areas (PAs) is a key factor for meeting biodiversity conservation targets.
                  Recent studies suggest that the proximity of communities to a PA influence to a significant extent their wellbeing levels.
                   This paper explores further this argument by analysing data from approximately 800 respondents living inside or near four PAs of international importance in Greece. 
                   A Bayesian regression modelling approach testing which factors influence subjective wellbeing was applied. While wellbeing is explained by a combination of factors, the results of the study reveal that it is mainly PAs' social impacts that have an effect on subjective wellbeing levels followed by the geographical location. 
                   This finding suggests that more effort needs to be invested in the equal distribution of PAs benefits in order to increase wellbeing and public support for these areas.</div></p>
